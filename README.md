# ML Libraries From Scratch

This repository is a work in progress where I am implementing various machine learning algorithms and libraries from scratch. The primary goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of the inner workings of machine learning techniques by building them without relying on pre-built libraries.

## Purpose
- To learn and implement machine learning algorithms from the ground up.
- To gain a deeper understanding of the mathematics and logic behind ML techniques.
- To improve coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Current Progress
This project is still under development. More algorithms and features will be added over time as I continue to learn and experiment.

## Disclaimer
This repository is for educational purposes only. The implementations may not be optimized for production use.

## Future Plans
- Add more algorithms (e.g., regression, classification, clustering, etc.).
- Include detailed explanations and comments for each implementation.
- Write unit tests to validate the correctness of the algorithms.

Stay tuned for updates!
